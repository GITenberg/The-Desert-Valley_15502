description: Professor James Edward Longstreet, retired university geologist, and
  his more practical daughter, Helen, have the courage, brains and determination to
  find gold and silver when they arrive in the Southwest desert - but they are inexperienced
  in field work and the deceptive ways of greedy men. They find both gold and a mystery,
  a hastily abandoned campsite marked by a stick with a bluejay feather on it, supper
  burning on the fire, and the tracks of a huge dog. Rancher Alan Howard invites them
  to his Desert Valley oasis, and on the way they pass one of their host's beef cattle
  butchered, with a poke of gold beside it. The Professor files his claim, but falls
  victim to a claim-jumping scam. The leader is a vicious crook with a beautiful woman
  ally who plays up to the seemingly innocent Professor - and Helen's warnings are
  in vain.
